## Project Insights
## Our Customers
- Majority of our customers are Adults, aged 35-64. This age-group are 49% of our total customers and they are followed by the Young Adults (25-34), which take 34% of the total customers. However, it seems those younger than 25 are now showing interest in the products while those older than 64 do not seem interested at all. 
- Our customers are categorically from 6 countries: United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, listed in order from highest to the lowest. Most of our customers are from the United States and Australia. 
## Sales Performance: 
- Over the years, there has been a steady increase in revenue, with sales peaking in 2015. However, there was a slight drop in 2016. -This report shows that Bikes are the product bringing in the most profit, generating over $20million, followed by Accessories and clothing with a profit of over $8million and about $2million respectively.
- Road-150 Red, 62" is ourtop selling product, swiftly followed by Mountain-200 Black, 38" and Road-150 Red, 52".
- On Revenue by Country, United State took the lead with over $27 million, followed by Australia ($21 million). However, it is noteworthy that despite Canada being where our third highest customer are located, it is the country that brings in the least sales. 

## Recommendation: 

- More marketing strategies need to be put in place in the European countries to increase the customer intersts in our products. 
- We also need to focus on boosting the popularity of the low sales products
- More marketing effort and promotions need to be done on the Accessories and Clothing to increase revenue.
